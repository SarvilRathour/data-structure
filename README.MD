100 Days of LeetCode - Data Structures & Algorithms

Welcome to my 100 Days of LeetCode challenge! 🚀
This repository contains solutions to various LeetCode problems in Rust. My goal is to strengthen problem-solving skills, consistency, and Rust programming expertise.

🌟 Challenge Overview

Challenge: 100 Days of LeetCode

Language: Rust 🦀

Objective: Solve one problem daily, building a strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, and Rust.

📁 Repository Structure
data-structure/
├── contain_duplicate/     # Day 1: Contains Duplicate
│   └── src/               # Rust source code
├── another_problem/       # Day 2: Problem Name
│   └── src/               # Rust source code
└── README.md              # This file

✅ Solved Problems (Day 1 Example)
Day	Problem Name	Language	Status	Link
1	Contains Duplicate	Rust	Solved	Code

(This table will be updated daily as I progress through the 100 Days challenge.)

🚀 How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/ken-kaneki-9/data-structure.git
cd data-structure/contain_duplicate


Run the Rust code:

cargo run

📌 Notes

All problems are solved in Rust.

Each problem has its own folder, typically with a src directory containing the solution.
